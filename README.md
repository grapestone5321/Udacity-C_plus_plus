# C++ For Programmers: Udacity-C++

C++ for Programmers is designed for students who are familiar with a programming language and wish to learn C++.

This course focuses on 'how' as opposed to 'what'. For example, in the lesson on functions, we do not teach what a function is, but rather how to create a function in C++.

The lessons are taught by several different instructors who have used C++ in their professional careers, so students get to experience different perspectives.

The course also includes comments and tips from Bjarne Stroustrup - the original designer of C++.

Hi everyone! My name is Saldina Nurak. 

I'm a 25-year-old software engineer and have been in the software industry since 2013. 

I started this channel during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way of giving my contribution, sharing the knowledge, making programming tutorials, answering questions related to this industry, and making fun developer life videos.

These videos are intended to help you to get a job, learn for your exams, learn to program for fun, and answer your questions about software engineering. 

Write in the comments what kind of videos and tutorials would you like to see on my channel in the future, and give a thumbs up to the existing ones that you like.

Enjoy!
