## C++ For Programmers

C++ for Programmers is designed for students who are familiar with a programming language and wish to learn C++.

This course focuses on 'how' as opposed to 'what'. For example, in the lesson on functions, we do not teach what a function is, but rather how to create a function in C++.

The lessons are taught by several different instructors who have used C++ in their professional careers, so students get to experience different perspectives.

The course also includes comments and tips from Bjarne Stroustrup - the original designer of C++.
